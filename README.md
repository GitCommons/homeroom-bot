# homeroom-bot
discord.js bot for instancing channels, categories, and threads for dynamic sets of users.


## The Problem
As servers grow, the probability of repeat socialization between any two users decreases. 
For this reason, large servers feel more isolated than small ones. 
This frequently leads to dead chats or even total collapse.


## The Solution
Instancing provides a homeroom (a standard set of channels and member cap) for users to retreat to, 
such that there will always be a group of familiar faces and repeat interactions to strengthen one's community. 
However, this brings a whole host of management and moderation challenges, which this bot hopes to solve.
